/*
 *  The ActionMapAction class is a convenience class that allows you to use
 *  an installed Action as an Action or ActionListener on a separate component.
 *
 *  It can be used on components like JButton or JMenuItem that support an
 *  Action as a property of the component. Or it can be added to the same
 *  above components as an ActionListener.
 *
 *  The benefit of this class is that a new ActionEvent will be created such
 *  that the source of the event is the component the Action belongs to, not
 *  the component that was "clicked". Otherwise in many cases a
 *  ClassCastException will be thrown when the Action is invoked.
